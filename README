1. Overview
===========

Bookaml is a library providing a basic API to gather information about a book
given its ISBN, or to find any number of books matching given search criteria.
It is closely tied to the Amazon Product Advertising API [1], which it uses
internally for retrieving book information.

Note that if you intend to use the library's facilities beyond basic validation
of ISBN numbers, you will need an Amazon Web Services account and associated
access keys.


2. Dependencies
===============

Bookaml depends on Batteries, Calendar, Cryptokit, and Ocamlnet's Netstring [2,3,4,5].
The optional auxiliary engines each have their own set of dependencies:

  * Bookaml_ocamlnet: Ocamlnet's Netclient and Tyxml [5,6].
  * Bookaml_ocsigen: Lwt, Ocsigenserver, and Tyxml [7,8,6].


3. Building and installing
==========================

The build system is generated with OASIS [9].  Run 'configure' if
you wish to modify the defaults.  Enter 'make' and 'make install'
to build and install the libraries.  Enter 'make doc' to generate
the API documentation.


4. License
