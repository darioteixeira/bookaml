1. Overview
===========

Bookaml is a library providing a basic API to gather information about a book
given its ISBN, or to find any number of books matching given search criteria.
It is closely tied to the Amazon Product Advertising API [1], which it uses
internally for retrieving book information.

Note that if you intend to use the library's facilities beyond basic validation
of ISBN numbers, you will need an Amazon Web Services account and associated
access keys.


2. Dependencies
===============

Bookaml depends on ExtLib, Calendar, Cryptokit, Lwt, and Ocsigen [2,3,4,5,6].


3. Building and installing
==========================

Typing 'make' suffices to build the Bookaml library.  After building,
'make install' will perform a findlib installation.  To generate the
ocamldoc API documentation, use 'make apidoc'.


4. License
==========
